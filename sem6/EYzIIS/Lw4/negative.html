    <h1>The Deception of Artificial Intelligence</h1>

    <div class="negative">
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a <strong>colossal disappointment</strong>, and the companies touting its greatness are nothing but <strong>deceitful charlatans</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Failed AI Implementations</h2>

    <p><span class="company">AlphaCorp's healthcare AI</span> is a <strong>dangerous joke</strong> that puts patients at risk with its unreliable diagnoses and treatment recommendations.</p>

    <p><span class="company">BetaTech's platform</span> is a <strong>costly mess</strong> that has wasted millions of dollars in development while delivering subpar results that no business would willingly pay for.</p>

    <p><span class="company">GammaSoft's stock market predictions</span> are a <strong>complete disaster</strong>, having lost investors more money than if they had simply flipped a coin to make trading decisions.</p>

    <div class="negative">
        <p class="quote">"AI is a deceitful, overhyped sham that has left us all bitterly disappointed and enraged."</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Reality Behind the Hype</h2>

    <p>The promises made by AI companies are consistently exaggerated, with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overstated capabilities that never materialize in real-world applications</li>
        <li>Hidden costs that emerge only after implementation has begun</li>
        <li>Dangerous flaws that are deliberately downplayed or concealed</li>
        <li>Complete disregard for the real-world consequences of failed systems</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>Artificial intelligence, as currently developed and marketed, represents one of the greatest technological frauds of our time, preying on hopes while delivering only frustration and failure.</p>
    </div>
